The C Protein Folding Library implements a modular system of source modules, that should be follows in order
to extend the core functionality of the library (which is rather minimal). 

Modules are clasified in the following types:
* sampling: implement sampling methodologies to move in conformational space.
* energy: implement energy functions.
* drivers: simulation driver modules that control the flow of a whole simulation.
* custom: user-defined calculations, such as secondary structure assignements, etc.

Finally data and types common to more than one module should be defined in the shared folder.
