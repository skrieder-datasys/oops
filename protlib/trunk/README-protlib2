The C Protein Folding Library (also known as protlib2) is a minimal libary of C funtions and data structures intended for generating folding simulations of proteins. It is based on a modular architecture that allows to use different sampling algorithms and energy functions.

It provides a Pyhton interface to use within the Bio.PDB module of the Biopython library.

1. How to compile
Using biopython source distribution, copy the folder Bio/PDB/Fold to Bio/PDB. Overwrite setup.py in the root source distribution of Biopython with the one provided here. 

Then run (from the root of Biopython distribution):

python setup.py build 
python setup.py install

If compiling on windows, you will need mingw or cygwin, in which case you can do:

python setup.py build -c mingw32
python setup.py install --skip-build
